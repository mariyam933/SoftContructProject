 * Testing strategy for PrevOrdersFrame class
 *
 * 1. Test Back Button Action:
   - Partition the input: clicking the back button
   - Click the back button and ensure that the PrevOrdersFrame is hidden.

 * 2. Test Get Orders Table:
   - Partition the input: customer with previous orders, customer with no previous orders
   - Get the orders table for a customer with previous orders.
   - Verify that the orders table is not null, the table model is not null, and the column count is as expected.

 * Note: Ensure that the tests cover both valid and boundary scenarios.
